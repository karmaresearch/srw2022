Since 2015, the **Stream Reasoning Workshop** has been a yearly event where scientists from different communities gather together to discuss problems and recent developments around the processing of rapidly changing data (data streams). 

Like in previous years, the workshop is **invitation-only** and focuses on strengthening this growing community by sharing different perspectives, challenges, and experiences obtained by working with expressive yet efficient decision-making over data streams.

## Location

After Vienna, Berlin, Zürich, Linköping, and Milan, the sixth edition of the workshop will be held on **December 5 and 6, 2022**. The event will take place at the [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://www.vu.nl), in the heart of the final district of the city. More information on how to reach the location will be added shortly.

## Where to stay

The VU 
situated in the financial district ([Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/QsZJtQiX5dxBiwpu7)) and it is a few minutes away from Schiphol.
All the buildings are situated within a close range. There are plenty of hotels
nearby. A good hotel is the [Crowne
Plaza](https://g.page/crowne-plaza-amsterdam-south?share). Another option, which is usually
cheaper, is the [Holiday Inn Express](https://goo.gl/maps/Xy6fk9d7v7jpPoea7). A third option, which was positively reviewed by previous guests of our group, is [citizenM](https://g.page/citizenm-amsterdam-south?share). All three options are at a walking distance. Alternatively, you can stay in an hotel in the city center. Amsterdam is a fairly compact city and the VU can be easily reached using the tram lines 5 or 25. Several hotels allow their guests to rent bikes. Indeed, the fastest way to travel through the city is by bike, but be aware that it can get quite busy during peak hours.
