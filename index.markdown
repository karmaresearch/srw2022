Since 2015, the **Stream Reasoning Workshop** has been a yearly event where scientists from different communities gather together to discuss problems and recent developments around the processing of rapidly changing data (data streams). 

Like in previous years, the workshop is **invitation-only** and focuses on strengthening this growing community by sharing different perspectives, challenges, and experiences obtained by working with expressive yet efficient decision-making over data streams.

## Location

After Vienna, Berlin, Zürich, Linköping, and Milan, the sixth edition of the workshop will be held on **December 5 and 6, 2022**. The event will take place at the [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://www.vu.nl), in the heart of the final district of the city. 
On Monday, the workshop will be on the third floor of the New University (NU) building. The rooms can be reached freely without any pre-registration. On Tuesday, the workshop will be take place on the main building. You can find a map of the campus [here](/srw2022/assets/map.pdf) with some annotations about the location of the two buildings.

## Workshop Schedule

<h4>Monday 05/12/2022</h4>

In the morning, the workshop will take place in **room NU-3B19** (3rd floor of the NU building)

                <div id="abstractPhilippe" class="collapse">Until recently, structured (e.g., relational) and unstructured (e.g., textual) data were managed very differently: Structured data was queried declaratively using languages such as SQL, while unstructured data was searched using boolean queries over inverted indices. Today, we witness the rapid emergence of Big Data Integration techniques leveraging knowledge graphs to bridge the gap between different types of contents and integrate both unstructured and structured information more effectively. I will start this talk by giving a few examples of Big Data Integration. I will then delve into modern data integration techniques leveraging neuro-symbolic architectures and online streaming aggregation, before describing a number of systems that were recently built in my lab in that context.</div>

## Where to stay

The VU 
situated in the financial district ([Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/QsZJtQiX5dxBiwpu7)) and it is a few minutes away from Schiphol.
All the buildings are situated within a close range. There are plenty of hotels
nearby. A good hotel is the [Crowne
Plaza](https://g.page/crowne-plaza-amsterdam-south?share). Another option, which is usually
cheaper, is the [Holiday Inn Express](https://goo.gl/maps/Xy6fk9d7v7jpPoea7). A third option, which was positively reviewed by previous guests of our group, is [citizenM](https://g.page/citizenm-amsterdam-south?share). All three options are at a walking distance. Alternatively, you can stay in an hotel in the city center. Amsterdam is a fairly compact city and the VU can be easily reached using the tram lines 5 or 25. Several hotels allow their guests to rent bikes. Indeed, the fastest way to travel through the city is by bike, but be aware that it can get quite busy during peak hours.
