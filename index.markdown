Since 2015, the **Stream Reasoning Workshop** is a yearly event where scientists from different communities (such as KR&R, Semantic Web, Databases, Stream Processing, Complex Event Processing, etc.) gather together to discuss problems and recent developments concerning the processing of rapidly changing data (data streams). 

Like in previous years, the workshop is **invitation-only** and focuses on strengthening this growing community by sharing different perspectives, challenges, and experiences obtained by working with expressive yet efficient decision-making over data streams.

## Location

After Vienna, Berlin, Zürich, Linköping, and Milan, the sixth edition of the workshop will be held in Amsterdam, on 08 and 09 December 2022.
The workshop will take place at the [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://www.vu.nl), in the heart of the final district of the city. More information on how to reach the location will be added shortly.
